<h1>About me</h1>

<h2>A little about me</h2>
</div>

<h4>I'm Sci-fi,Fantasy, Gaming and Heavy Metal Nerd, who lives in a small town in the North West of England, who until recently had a very interesting working career in warehousing and factory work. And fancies himself as a software/game developer, hopefully before he's 45!

<div>
As mentioned before, I have been recently leaning how it code python, html and CSS, something I had a passing interest in, and leant a little, mostly html when I was younger, and after I built my own PC's. I wanted at one point to maybe learn how to develope my own software, or make my own app, but thinking I needed to have a collage or university degree, I sort of left it in my dreams, and never spoken about it much
</div>

Fast forward 2021, the year after the Pandemic, I had a lot to think about in terms of what I wanted to do with my life, and after being out of work for well over 18 months I was asked what I wanted to do, and I thought to myself, shall I shall ask about coding, thinking nothing will come of it, i was put in the direction of Code Nation, and enrolled in one of the their many coding courses, so i recently started a 3 week basic coding course, in which I leant how to use Python and make a text based adventure game, implementing the skills I leant using Python, and within a few days, my team of 3, where able to code, run and make game work, which we was all happy with.

Now after using html and CSS, i hopefully will be able to look forward to a career as a Website/game/software developer.
